The huge shallow calm lagoon on one side with wall like reef made of marine live coral boulders blocks the incoming swells of the outer sea. The islands are linked to the mainland by: ‚Äì ship, helicopter, Indian Airlines, Kingfisher Airlines and mechanized sailing wooden vessels. In all the islands, elaborate infrastructure is in place to meet the needs of tourists.
